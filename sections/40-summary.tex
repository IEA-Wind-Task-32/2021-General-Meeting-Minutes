\section{Summary}
The 2021 Task 32 General Meeting brought together wind lidar researchers and end users from industry, academia, and government over three, 3-hour sessions over 3 days to explore how to identify and mitigate the barriers to the adoption of wind lidar technology for wind energy applications.

The first day was an opportunity for the Task members and the 15 ITN LIKE early stage researchers to meet other and share experience. Later panel sessions explored the use of wind lidar for offshore wind energy and the opportunities for lidar-assisted controls.

Task 32 comes to the end of its current phase in December 2021. A relaunch of the Task has been proposed to the IEA Wind ExCo and is under review. The final day of the 2021 General Meeting reviewed and revised the plans for the relaunched Task. The working groups that were active in 2021 will continue alongside new initiatives.

Task 32 and its successor welcome anyone interested in working together on research to make wind lidar the best and preferred wind measurement tool for wind energy applications. Please see \href{https://iea-wind.org/task32/}{iea-wind.org} for details.
