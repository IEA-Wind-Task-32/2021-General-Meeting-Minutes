\subsection{Working sessions}

The participants split into groups to refine the plans for each of the themes. The participants reviewed the existing plans, modified the deliverables, and set out timetables to work towards the deliverables. These plans will be used to get the relaunched Task moving. Each group presented their plans back to the meeting at the end of the session.
